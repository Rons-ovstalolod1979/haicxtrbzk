Oh man, where do I even begin with Demon City? Just got out and my brain feels like it’s been shook up like a snow globe and I can't seem to brush off the popcorn crumbs stuck to my hoodie. You’d love it, I think? Or maybe you'd just go, “What the actual hell?” anyway, what a ride.

> So there’s this scene where the city, it’s like alive or something?? Concrete buildings grow like they’ve fed steroids, twisting like those swirly tattoos I did last December. But alive, you know? At the time, I was trying to adjust myself on those godawful sticky movie seats. My back's still pissed, and oh man, does that one part with the demon eyes remind you of that poster Gina had in her studio? So trippy.

This ain’t your classic jump scare kind of flick. It’s more like they took a chunk of my artist night terrors and slapped them onto a screen. Oh, that one demon with those elongated arms, reaching out like I do when I'm exhausted at work, trying to grab another ink pot from across the room. Another movie lover (or hater?) in the row ahead was coughing through the climax, nearly drowned out the screeches.

> And the noise, dude, like a symphony of chaos crashing against your brain waves. Literally felt as if someone tried downloading the movie into my skull, sound first. It’s...off. But kinda like how I felt after the haunted house visit last summer—spent but wanting to redo the route backward. Watching Demon City is like if Salvador Dali made a horror flick on an all-night Red Bull binge.

I guess you gotta just watch the movie for what it is. I’d say it’s like tattooing while the customer squirms, occasionally poetic in its warped madness but mostly like fighting a laugh during a serious moment. Almost feel like I need to draw something, pour this weird energy onto skin or canvas—something, you know?

Okay, wrapping up my rambling. Was it you or Pete who wanted to download the movie later? You gotta feel this one rattle your bones in surround sound.
